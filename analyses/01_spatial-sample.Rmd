# County boundaries

Using `20m` (most generlized) file.

```{r load, include=FALSE}
counties_raw <- st_read("data-raw/Raw files/Spatial/cb_2018_us_county_20m/cb_2018_us_county_20m.shp") %>% 
  select(-ALAND, -AWATER)

qtm(counties_raw)
View(st_drop_geometry(counties_raw))

# to exclude
counties_raw %>% 
  filter(STATEFP == 15 | STATEFP >= 60) %>% 
  qtm(fill = "purple", borders = NULL)

counties <- counties_raw %>% 
  filter(STATEFP != 15) %>% 
  filter(STATEFP < 60)

# saving prep file for Stata
counties %>% 
  mutate(fips = as.integer(GEOID)) %>% 
  rename(state_code = STATEFP) %>% 
  select(fips, state_code) %>% 
  st_write("data/cb_2018_us_county_20m_prep.shp", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

Excluding Hawaii & Puerto Rico

```{r}
qtm(counties, borders = "purple", fill = NULL)
```

We have `r nrow(counties)` counties and 5% sample would mean `r round(nrow(counties)*0.05)` polygons.

Also - important to notice - there are two counties with no neighbours


```{r}
counties %>% 
  slice(2463) %>% 
  qtm(borders = "purple", fill = NULL)
```


```{r}
counties %>% 
  slice(2727) %>% 
  qtm(borders = "purple", fill = NULL)
```

# Solution 1: picking one state at random

Might be an option. Must be the same in between runs? Most likely not enough counties?

```{r}
length(unique(counties$STATEFP))
selected <- sample(unique(counties$STATEFP), 1)

selected

counties %>% 
  filter(STATEFP == selected) %>% 
  select(NAME) %>% 
  nrow()

counties %>% 
  filter(STATEFP == selected) %>% 
  qtm(borders = "purple", fill = NULL)
```


# Solution 2: picking fixed state 

```{r}
selected <- 48
```

Texas as the biggest state that gives `r round((nrow(counties[counties$STATEFP == selected,])/nrow(counties))*100, digits = 1)` data?

```{r}
counties %>% 
  filter(STATEFP == selected) %>% 
  select(NAME) %>% 
  nrow()

counties %>% 
  filter(STATEFP == selected) %>% 
  qtm(borders = "purple", fill = NULL)
```

# Solution 3: `st_sample` 

Unfortunately non contiguous :/

```{r}
sample <- st_sample(counties, 
                    size = round(nrow(counties)*0.05), 
                    type = "random") 

sample %>% 
  qtm()

st_join(counties, st_sf(sample), join = st_intersects, left = FALSE) %>% 
  qtm(borders = "purple", fill = NULL)
```
